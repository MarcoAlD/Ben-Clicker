# Project X: Project Name

## Overview

This is a clicker game that has upgrades, levels, auto-clickers, and more to make a clicker game
that is fully functionable and fun. The clicker is based off fictional characters, Ben, Aina, and Cora.

## Compiling and Using

To compile this code, you need a IDE like Visual Studio Code that can use Java extensions to run the code. 
To use this project, it requires a lot of user input since it's a clicker game that needs you to click on all
sorts of buttons. 

## Discussion

I had few issues until it came to the shop and inventory. The shop would hardly work and the inventory wouldn't
work like I wanted to. The whole point of the inventory was to allow the user to equip and unequip the items that
they wanted to equip/unequip. I fixed the inventory by just getting rid of it and making a built in inventory inside 
the shops. I made a small diagram of how my clicker game was to be laid out and then just starting going in, adding 
methods and the GUI. I had to research how to make an inventory, that I ended up not using in the end. I kept getting
nullpointerexception errors because of the amount of empty variables I had that I kept forgetting about. I just had to 
go through my code mulitiple times to get rid of variables that I didn't need. The only part of the project that I found
challenging was the auto clickers and the shops. What finally clicked for me in the process of working in this project was
how to equip and unequip items without using an inventory system. If I could go back to this project, I would definitely
add more features and make it look more visually appealing. I can definitely apply what I learned in this project to future
projects since I learned to be more prepared when it comes to big projects.

## Testing

I tested this project by running through every possible user input that a user can do and fixing any issues that occured along the way.
